Definition admit {T: Type} : T.  Admitted.

(** **** Problem #1 : 1 star (andb3) *)
(** Do the same for the [andb3] function below. This function should
    return [true] when all of its inputs are [true], and [false]
    otherwise. *)

Definition andb3 (b1:bool) (b2:bool) (b3:bool) : bool :=
match b1 with true => andb b2 b3 | _ => false end.

Example test_andb31:                 (andb3 true true true) = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb32:                 (andb3 false true true) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb33:                 (andb3 true false true) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb34:                 (andb3 true true false) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** **** Problem #2: 1 star (factorial) *)
(** Recall the standard factorial function:
<<
    factorial(0)  =  1 
    factorial(n)  =  n * factorial(n-1)     (if n>0)
>>
    Translate this into Coq. 

    Note that plus and multiplication are already defined in Coq.
    use "+" for plus and "*" for multiplication.
*)

Eval compute in 3 * 5.
Eval compute in 3+5*6.

Fixpoint factorial (n:nat) : nat := 
match n with 0 => 1 | S p => n * (factorial p) end.

Example test_factorial1:          (factorial 3) = 6.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_factorial2:          (factorial 5) = 10 * 12.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** **** Problem #3: 2 stars (blt_nat) *)
(** The [blt_nat] function tests [nat]ural numbers for [l]ess-[t]han,
    yielding a [b]oolean.  Use [Fixpoint] to define it. *)

Fixpoint blt_nat (n m : nat) : bool :=
match n, m with
| 0, 0 => false
| 0, S p => true
| S p, 0 => false
| S a, S b => blt_nat a b
end.

Example test_blt_nat1:             (blt_nat 2 2) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_blt_nat2:             (blt_nat 2 4) = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_blt_nat3:             (blt_nat 4 2) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
