(* Important: 
   - You are NOT allowed to use the [admit] tactic
     because [admit] simply admits any goal 
     regardless of whether it is provable or not.

     But, you can leave [admit] for problems that you cannot prove.
     Then you will get zero points for those problems.

   - You are NOT allowed to use the following tactics.

     [tauto], [intuition], [firstorder], [omega].

   - Do NOT add any additional `Require Import/Export`.
